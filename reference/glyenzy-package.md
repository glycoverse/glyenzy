# glyenzy: Deconstruction Glycosylation Biosynthesis

Simulates the biosynthetic process of glycosylation in silico, enabling
computational analysis of glycan biosynthesis pathways. Key features
include: identifying specific glycosyltransferases responsible for each
glycosidic bond at the bond level; reconstructing complete biosynthetic
pathways for given glycans; exploring possible transformations between
two glycan structures via glycosyltransferases and glycosidases; and
predicting glycans that can be synthesized from substrate structures and
enzyme sets. The package supports multiple glycan types including
N-glycans, O-GalNAc, O-Man, O-GlcNAc, O-Fuc, and O-Glc. As a downstream
component of the glycoverse ecosystem, it integrates seamlessly with
'glyrepr', 'glyparse', and 'glymotif' to provide practical,
analysis-ready insights into glycan biosynthesis for omics researchers.
