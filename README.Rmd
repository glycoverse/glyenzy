The glyenzy package helps simulate the biosynthetic process of glycosylation in silico. 
Key features include: identifying the specific glycosyltransferase responsible for each glycosidic bond; 
reconstructing the biosynthetic pathway of a given glycan; 
exploring possible transformations between two glycan structures via glycosyltransferases and glycosidases; 
and predicting the glycans that can be synthesized from a given substrate structure and a set of enzymes.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glyenzy from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyenzy@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyenzy")
```

## Role in `glycoverse`

As one of the most downstream components of the `glycoverse` ecosystem,
this package builds on `glyrepr`, `glyparse`, and `glymotif`,
with planned integration with `glydraw`.
It is intended for direct use by omics researchers,
providing practical, analysis-ready insights into glycan biosynthesis.

## Example

```{r}
library(glyrepr)
library(glyenzy)
```

Say we have a glycan...

```{r}
glycan <- "Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-6)[Gal(b1-3)]GalNAc(a1-"
```

And you want to know what enzymes participates in the biosynthesis of this glycan...

```{r}
get_involved_enzymes(glycan)
```

Here you go!

What if you're curious of what new glycans can by generated by applying ST3GAL2?

```{r}
apply_enzyme(glycan, "ST3GAL2")
```
