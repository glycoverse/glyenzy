Description: 
    Simulates the biosynthetic process of glycosylation in silico, enabling
    computational analysis of glycan biosynthesis pathways. Key features include:
    identifying specific glycosyltransferases responsible for each glycosidic bond
    at the bond level; reconstructing complete biosynthetic pathways for given
    glycans; exploring possible transformations between two glycan structures via
    glycosyltransferases and glycosidases; and predicting glycans that can be
    synthesized from substrate structures and enzyme sets. The package supports
    multiple glycan types including N-glycans, O-GalNAc, O-Man, O-GlcNAc, O-Fuc,
    and O-Glc. As a downstream component of the glycoverse ecosystem, it integrates
    seamlessly with 'glyrepr', 'glyparse', and 'glymotif' to provide practical,
    analysis-ready insights into glycan biosynthesis for omics researchers.
