**Note:** This package is currently under development and is not for
production use.

The glyenzy package helps simulate the biosynthetic process of
glycosylation in silico. Key features include: identifying the specific
glycosyltransferase responsible for each glycosidic bond; reconstructing
the biosynthetic pathway of a given glycan; exploring possible
transformations between two glycan structures via glycosyltransferases
and glycosidases; and predicting the glycans that can be synthesized
from a given substrate structure and a set of enzymes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyenzy from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyenzy")
```

## Example

Coming soon!
