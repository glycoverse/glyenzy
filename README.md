> production use.**

The glyenzy package helps simulate the biosynthetic process of
glycosylation in silico. Key features include: identifying the specific
glycosyltransferase responsible for each glycosidic bond; reconstructing
the biosynthetic pathway of a given glycan; exploring possible
transformations between two glycan structures via glycosyltransferases
and glycosidases; and predicting the glycans that can be synthesized
from a given substrate structure and a set of enzymes.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glyenzy from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyenzy@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyenzy")
```

## Example

``` r
library(glyrepr)
library(glyenzy)
```

Say we have a glycan…

``` r
glycan <- "Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-6)[Gal(b1-3)]GalNAc(a1-"
```

And you want to know what enzymes participates in the biosynthesis of
this glycan…

``` r
get_involved_enzymes(glycan)
#> [1] "B4GALT1" "B4GALT2" "B4GALT3" "B4GALT4" "B4GALT5" "C1GALT1" "GCNT1"  
#> [8] "GCNT3"   "GCNT4"
```

Here you go!

What if you’re curious of what new glycans can by generated by applying
ST3GAL2?

``` r
apply_enzyme(glycan, "ST3GAL2")
#> <glycan_structure[1]>
#> [1] Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)[Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-6)]GalNAc(a1-
#> # Unique structures: 1
```
