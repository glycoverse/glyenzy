\title{Determine Whether a Glycan Is Synthesized by a Given Enzyme}
\usage{
is_synthesized_by(glycans, enzyme)
}
\arguments{
\item{glycans}{A \code{\link[glyrepr:glycan_structure]{glyrepr::glycan_structure()}}, or a character vector of
glycan structure strings supported by \code{\link[glyparse:auto_parse]{glyparse::auto_parse()}}.}

\item{enzyme}{An \code{\link[=enzyme]{enzyme()}} or a gene symbol.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as \code{glycans}.
}
\description{
Glycans are produced through a series of enzymatic reactions.
This function checks whether a specific enzyme participates
in the biosynthesis of a given glycan (or glycans).
}
\section{Important notes}{
Here are some important notes for all functions in the \code{glyenzy} package.
\subsection{Applicability}{

All algorithms and enzyme information in glyenzy are applicable only to humans,
and specifically to N-glycans and O-GalNAc glycans.
Results may be inaccurate for other types of glycans (e.g., GAGs, glycolipids)
or for glycans in other species (e.g., plants, insects).
}

\subsection{Inclusiveness}{

The algorithm takes an intentionally inclusive approach,
assuming that all possible isoenzymes capable of catalyzing
a given reaction may be involved.
Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.

For example, in humans, detection of the motif "Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-" will return
both "ST3GAL3" and "ST3GAL4". In reality, only one of them might be active, depending
on factors such as tissue specificity.
}

\subsection{Only "concrete" glycans}{

The function only works for glycans containing \strong{concrete} residues
(e.g., \code{"Glc"}, \code{"GalNAc"}), and not for glycans with \strong{generic}
residues (e.g., \code{"Hex"}, \code{"HexNAc"}).
}

\subsection{Substituents}{

Subtituents (e.g. sulfation, phosphorylation) is not supported yet,
and the algorithms might fail for glycans with subtituents.
If your glycans contains substituents,
use \code{\link[glyrepr:remove_substituents]{glyrepr::remove_substituents()}} to get clean glycans.
}

\subsection{Incomplete glycan structures}{

If the glycan structure is incomplete or partially degraded,
the result may be misleading.
}

\subsection{Starting points}{

Throughout \code{glyenzy}, the starting glycan is the Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) precursor for N-glycans,
and GalNAc(a1- for O-glycans.
This means that enzymes involved in N-glycan precursor biosynthesis, mainly ALGs,
and OST, which transfered the precursor to Asn, are not considered here.
Similarly, GALNTs for O-glycans are not considered.
}
}

\section{Algorithm}{
The basic approach is straightforward: for each reaction rule
associated with the enzyme, the function checks whether the
corresponding product motif appears in the glycan.
If any rule matches, the function returns \code{TRUE}.

For N-glycans, additional logic is applied to handle special cases.
Products of \strong{MGAT1} are often further trimmed
by glycoside hydrolases, meaning that the final glycan product may no longer
contain the original motif.
In these cases, the function instead looks for specific motif markers
to determine enzyme involvement.

\examples{
library(glyrepr)
library(glyparse)

# Use `glycan_structure()` and `enzyme()`
glycan <- auto_parse("Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-")
is_synthesized_by(glycan, enzyme("ST6GAL1"))

# Or use characters directly
is_synthesized_by("Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-", "ST6GAL1")

# Vectorized input
glycans <- c(
  "Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-",
  "Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-"
)
