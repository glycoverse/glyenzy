\title{Is a Glycan Synthesized by an Enzyme?}
\usage{
is_synthesized_by(glycans, enzyme)
}
\arguments{
\item{glycans}{A \code{\link[glyrepr:glycan_structure]{glyrepr::glycan_structure()}}, or a character vector of
glycan structure strings supported by \code{\link[glyparse:auto_parse]{glyparse::auto_parse()}}.}

\item{enzyme}{An \code{\link[=enzyme]{enzyme()}} or a gene symbol.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as \code{glycans}.
}
\description{
Glycans are synthesized by a series of enzymatic reactions.
This function checks if an enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of a glycan.

Only works for glycans with "concrete" residues (e.g. "Glc", "GalNAc"),
not "generic" residues (e.g. "Hex", "HexNAc").
}
\details{
The implementation is simple: for each rule of the enzyme,
check if the product motif exists in the glycan.
If any rule is satisfied, return TRUE.

For N-glycans, we have additional logic to handle special cases.
The products of ALG enzymes and MGAT1 are further trimmed by other exoglycosidases.
Therefore, checking the product doesn't reflect the enzyme's involvement.
We checks special motif markers for these enzymes.

\examples{
library(glyrepr)
library(glyparse)

# Use `glycan_structure()` and `enzyme()`
glycan <- auto_parse("Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-")
is_synthesized_by(glycan, enzyme("ST6GAL1"))

# Or use characters directly
is_synthesized_by("Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-", "ST6GAL1")

# Vectorized input
glycans <- c(
  "Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-",
  "Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-"
)
is_synthesized_by(glycans, "ST6GAL1")
