\usage{
enzyme(symbol)
}
\arguments{
\item{symbol}{The gene symbol of the enzyme.}
}
\value{
A \code{glyenzy_enzyme} object.
}
\description{
Glycosylation is catalyzed by two types of enzymes: glycosyltransferases (GTs) and exoglycosidases (GDs).
Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a sugar residue from a donor to an acceptor.
Exoglycosidases catalyze the removal of a sugar residue from a substrate.
\code{glyenzy} provides a data structure (\code{glyenzy_enzyme}) to represent these enzymes.

Use \code{enzyme()} with a gene symbol to load a predefined enzyme.
For example, use \code{enzyme("ST3GAL3")} to load the enzyme ST3GAL3.

Throughout the package, you can use \code{enzyme()}s for any \code{enzyme} argument,
or just use the gene symbol directly.
For example, \code{involve("Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-", "ST3GAL3")} and
\code{involve("Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-", enzyme("ST3GAL3"))} are equivalent.

\section{Explanation about \code{glyenzy_enzyme}}{
An \code{enzyme()} is a list with the following elements:
\enumerate{
\item \code{name}: the name of the enzyme, usually the gene symbol.
\item \code{rules}: a list of \code{glyenzy_enzyme_rule} objects.
Each rule is a list with five fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{acceptor}: the motif that the enzyme recognizes
\item \code{acceptor_alignment}: the alignment of the \code{acceptor}
\item \code{rejects}: the motifs that the enzyme reject to act on
\item \code{rejects_alignment}: the alignment of \code{rejects}
\item \code{product}: the product generated by the enzyme
}
\item \code{type}: the type of the enzyme, "GT" for glycosyltransferase or "GD" for exoglycosidase.
\item \code{species}: the species of the enzyme, e.g. "human" or "mouse".
}

You can see all these information by printing the enzyme object.
}

\section{Create a Custom Enzyme}{
Create a custom enzyme is non-trivial, and usually you don't need to.
If you still want to do so, you can use the internal functions
\code{new_enzyme()}, \code{new_enzyme_rule()}, and \code{new_motif_set()}.
These functions are not exported, so you need to use the triple colon
operator (\code{:::}) to access them.
