enzyme(symbol)

\item{symbol}{The gene symbol of the enzyme.}

\value{
A \code{glyenzy_enzyme} object.

\description{
Glycosylation is catalyzed by two types of enzymes: glycosyltransferases (GTs) and exoglycosidases (GDs).
Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a sugar residue from a donor to an acceptor.
Exoglycosidases catalyze the removal of a sugar residue from a substrate.
\code{glyenzy} provides a data structure (\code{glyenzy_enzyme}) to represent these enzymes.

Use \code{enzyme()} with a gene symbol to load a predefined enzyme.
For example, use \code{enzyme("ST3GAL3")} to load the enzyme ST3GAL3.

Throughout the package, you can use \code{enzyme()}s for any \code{enzyme} argument,
or just use the gene symbol directly.
For example, \code{involve("Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-", "ST3GAL3")} and
\code{involve("Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-", enzyme("ST3GAL3"))} are equivalent.

\section{Explanation about \code{glyenzy_enzyme}}{
An \code{enzyme()} is a list with the following elements:
\enumerate{
\item \code{name}: the name of the enzyme, usually the gene symbol.
\item \code{rules}: a list of \code{glyenzy_enzyme_rule} objects.
Each rule is a list with three fields: the \code{acceptor}, \code{product}, and \code{acceptor_alignment}.
\code{acceptor} and \code{product} are \code{glyrepr_structure} objects with length 1.
\code{acceptor_alignment} is a character string specifying the alignment of the \code{acceptor}.
\code{acceptor} is what the enzyme recognizes, and \code{product} is what the enzyme generates.
An enzyme can have multiple rules.
\item \code{rejects}: a \code{glyenzy_motif_set} object representing the motifs that the enzyme rejects.
Even if a glycan satisfies one of the rules, if it contains a reject motif,
the enzyme will not act on it.
\item \code{markers}: a \code{glyenzy_motif_set} object representing the motifs that
indicate the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of a glycan.
If the enzyme is a glycosyltransferase (GT),
the enzyme is involved if the glycan contains the marker in its product side.
If the enzyme is an exoglycosidase (GD),
the enzyme is involved if the glycan does not contain the marker in its product side.
Multiple markers are combined with logical OR.
Markers can be empty. In this case, it is not possible to determine if the enzyme is involved.
\item \code{type}: the type of the enzyme, "GT" for glycosyltransferase or "GD" for exoglycosidase.
\item \code{species}: the species of the enzyme, e.g. "human" or "mouse".
}

You can see all these information by printing the enzyme object.

\section{Create a Custom Enzyme}{
Create a custom enzyme is non-trivial, and usually you don't need to.
If you still want to do so, you can use the internal functions
\code{new_enzyme()}, \code{new_enzyme_rule()}, and \code{new_motif_set()}.
These functions are not exported, so you need to use the triple colon
operator (\code{:::}) to access them.
