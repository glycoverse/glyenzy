\title{glyenzy: Deconstruction Glycosylation Biosynthesis}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Simulates the biosynthetic process of glycosylation in silico, enabling computational analysis of glycan biosynthesis pathways. Key features include: identifying specific glycosyltransferases responsible for each glycosidic bond at the bond level; reconstructing complete biosynthetic pathways for given glycans; exploring possible transformations between two glycan structures via glycosyltransferases and glycosidases; and predicting glycans that can be synthesized from substrate structures and enzyme sets. The package supports multiple glycan types including N-glycans, O-GalNAc, O-Man, O-GlcNAc, O-Fuc, and O-Glc. As a downstream component of the glycoverse ecosystem, it integrates seamlessly with 'glyrepr', 'glyparse', and 'glymotif' to provide practical, analysis-ready insights into glycan biosynthesis for omics researchers.
