\title{Create a Glyco-Enzyme}
\usage{
create_enzyme(name, acceptor, product, type, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the enzyme.}

\item{acceptor}{A \code{glyrepr_structure} object or a glycan structure string representing the acceptor.
The acceptor is the substrate that the enzyme acts on.}

\item{product}{A \code{glyrepr_structure} object or a glycan structure string representing the product.
The product is the glycan after the enzyme acts.}

\item{type}{The type of the enzyme, "GT" for glycosyltransferase or "GD" for exoglycosidase.}

\item{species}{The species of the enzyme, e.g. "human" or "mouse".}
}
\value{
A \code{glyenzy_enzyme} object.
}
\description{
An glyco-enzyme is a biological catalyst that processes one glycan into another.
Two types of enzymes are supported: glycosyltransferases (GT) and exoglycosidases (GD).
Glycosyltransferases add a monosaccharide to the terminal of a glycan,
while exoglycosidases remove a monosaccharide from the terminal of a glycan.
}
\details{
\code{acceptor} and \code{product} must follow these rules:
\enumerate{
\item \code{acceptor} and \code{product} must be a single glycan structure.
\item For GTs, \code{product} must have exactly one more residue that \code{acceptor},
and the extra residue must locate at the terminal.
\item For GDs, \code{acceptor} must have exactly one more residue that \code{product},
and the extra residue must locate at the terminal.
}
