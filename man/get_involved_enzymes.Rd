\title{Identify Potentially Involved Enzymes}
\usage{
get_involved_enzymes(glycans, return_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{glycans}{A \code{\link[glyrepr:glycan_structure]{glyrepr::glycan_structure()}}, or a character vector of
glycan structure strings supported by \code{\link[glyparse:auto_parse]{glyparse::auto_parse()}}.}

\item{return_list}{If \code{NULL} (default),
return a list of character vectors when \code{glycans} has length greater than 1,
and a single character vector when \code{glycans} has length 1.
Set to \code{TRUE} to always return a list.
This can be useful when you are working programmatically with unknown input length.
Note that when \code{return_list = FALSE} and \code{length(glycans) > 1},
an error will be thrown.}
}
\value{
A character vector or a list of character vectors (see \code{return_list} parameter),
each containing the names of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the corresponding glycan.
}
\description{
This function returns all possible isoenzymes associated with the biosynthetic
steps of the input glycan.
Note that this function ignores the residues in glycans
that cannot be matched to any enzyme rules.

\section{Important notes}{
Here are some important notes for all functions in the \code{glyenzy} package.
\subsection{Applicability}{

All algorithms and enzyme information in glyenzy are applicable only to humans,
and specifically to N-glycans and O-GalNAc glycans.
Results may be inaccurate for other types of glycans (e.g., GAGs, glycolipids)
or for glycans in other species (e.g., plants, insects).
}

\subsection{Inclusiveness}{

The algorithm takes an intentionally inclusive approach,
assuming that all possible isoenzymes capable of catalyzing
a given reaction may be involved.
Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.

For example, in humans, detection of the motif "Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-" will return
both "ST3GAL3" and "ST3GAL4". In reality, only one of them might be active, depending
on factors such as tissue specificity.
}

\subsection{Only "concrete" glycans}{

The function only works for glycans containing \strong{concrete} residues
(e.g., \code{"Glc"}, \code{"GalNAc"}), and not for glycans with \strong{generic}
residues (e.g., \code{"Hex"}, \code{"HexNAc"}).
}

\subsection{Substituents}{

Subtituents (e.g. sulfation, phosphorylation) is not supported yet,
and the algorithms might fail for glycans with subtituents.
If your glycans contains substituents,
use \code{\link[glyrepr:remove_substituents]{glyrepr::remove_substituents()}} to get clean glycans.
}

\subsection{Incomplete glycan structures}{

If the glycan structure is incomplete or partially degraded,
the result may be misleading.
}

\subsection{Starting points}{
\itemize{
\item For N-glycans, the starting structure is assumed to be "Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)",
the N-glycan precursor transfered to Asn by OST.
\item For O-GalNAc glycans, the starting structure is assumed to be "GalNAc(a1-".
\item For O-GlcNAc glycans, the starting structure is assumed to be "GlcNAc(b1-".
\item For O-Man glycans, the starting structure is assumed to be "Man(a1-".
\item For O-Fuc glycans, the starting structure is assumed to be "Fuc(a1-".
\item For O-Glc glycans, the starting structure is assumed to be "Glc(b1-".
}
}

\examples{
library(glyrepr)
library(glyparse)

# Use `glycan_structure()`
glycans <- auto_parse(c(
  "GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-",
  "GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-3)[GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-"
))
get_involved_enzymes(glycans)

# Or use characters directly
get_involved_enzymes("GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-")
